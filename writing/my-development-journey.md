# My Development Journey: From Product Manager to Builder

After years of working with engineers as a product manager, I've decided to dive deeper into the technical side of building products. This post reflects on that journey and what I've learned so far.

## Why Make the Switch?

Working closely with engineering teams gave me a deep appreciation for the craft of software development. I found myself increasingly curious about:

- How modern web applications are architected
- The trade-offs between different technical approaches  
- What it feels like to build something from scratch

## What I'm Learning

### Modern Web Development
- **Next.js and React**: The component-based approach to building UIs
- **TypeScript**: Adding type safety to JavaScript development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling that makes design consistent

### Backend Concepts
- **Databases**: Understanding when to use SQL vs NoSQL
- **APIs**: REST vs GraphQL trade-offs
- **Hosting and Deployment**: Static sites vs dynamic applications

## Key Insights

### 1. Product Sense + Technical Skills = Powerful Combination
My product management background helps me make better technical decisions. Understanding user needs guides architectural choices.

### 2. Start Simple, Add Complexity Gradually
The temptation is to use the latest, most sophisticated tools. But simple solutions often work better and are easier to maintain.

### 3. Learning by Building
Reading documentation is helpful, but there's no substitute for actually building something and encountering real problems.

## What's Next

I'm planning to:
- Build more personal projects to reinforce learning
- Contribute to open source projects
- Share what I learn through writing and documentation

The journey from product manager to builder is challenging but incredibly rewarding. Every small win feels like a major victory.
